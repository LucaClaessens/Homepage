<section id="about">
  <p>
    Hello, I am Luca &ndash; a Dutch born developer & digital designer who is
    passionate about meaningful, ethical, accessible digital experiences that
    leave a positive impact on people and their environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my studies at
    <a href="https://www.designacademy.nl/">Design Academy Eindhoven</a>
    i've made the decision to operate inbetween design and development. I care
    about tools that work well, for everyone who interfaces with them. By
    applying my understanding of design processes I aim to be instrumental in
    realizing intuitive, high standard, digital experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently looking for work opportunities. If I sound like a good fit
    for your team or you want to discuss a project,

    .
