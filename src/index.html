                        Hello, I am Luca &ndash; a Dutch born developer & digital designer who is passionate about meaningful, ethical,
                        accessible
                        digital
                        experiences that leave a positive impact on people and their environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        During my studies at <a href="https://www.designacademy.nl/"> Design Academy Eindhoven</a> i've made the decision to
                        operate inbetween design and development. I care about tools that work well, for everyone who interfaces with them.
                        By
                        applying my understanding of design processes I aim to be instrumental in realizing intuitive, high standard,
                        digital
                        experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        I am currently looking for work opportunities. If I sound like a good fit for your team or you want to discuss a
                        project,
                        <a href="mailto:lucaclae@gmail.com">get in touch with me</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        References and CV are available upon request.
