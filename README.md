A few simple scripts are available:

* `dev` - Starts a local development server on port 3000.
* `build` - Builds the source files into a dist folder.
* `export` - Generate static files
* `deploy` - Builds the code, then deploys to firebase. Somehow circumventing netlify here. Don't remember why.

Todos

* Handle image fallbacks for safari
* Resolve mangled firebase / netlify  dependencies
