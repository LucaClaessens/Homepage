It's usual that when land displacement measurements are done, they are done by bringing specialized equipment to a location, and measurements are made by lidar. A client envisioned a different way to do this, and kickstarted a project where constant monitoring of displacement and realtime visualisation were needed. Among other services, we were briefed with creating an application that could visualize and monitor the movement of wall segments of residences in an area destabilized by natural gas extraction. The information had to be visible in real time, making the information accessible to residents and project managers, whenever they desired.

This wish resulted in a web app where residents can monitor the movement of their house's walls. Navigatable by geolocation. An existing system that aggregated measurements was in scale, but the desire was to be able o run this application for thousands of houses. I was part of the team that migrated the application from bigQuery to a time-series database and was in charge of the UX, UI and frontend development.
