The Online Museum is a project by [Fiona Herrod](https://www.fionaherrod.com) which functions as both a museum and as an on-going research project into ways that online museums can be configured.

My role in the project was to develop a working prototype of the museum: both a front- and backend suitable for the museum to get up and running in the leanest way possible. The museum is a web app that uses angular as a frontend solution and utilizes the firebase environment for a scalable, easy to manage backend.

The platform presents different ways that content (collections, objects, artworks etc) can be displayed online. It is an on-going exploration into the ways a ‘museum’ and digital exhibitions can function when it exists within the digital realm and is located online.
