The Online Museum is a project by [Fiona Herrod](https://www.fionaherrod.com) which functions as both a museum and as an on-going research project into ways that online museums can be configured.

My role in the project was to develop a minimum viable project, both a front- and backend suitable for the museum to get up and running. The museum is a progressive web app that uses angular and firestore to function.

The platform presents different ways that content (collections, objects, artworks etc) can be displayed online. It is an on-going exploration into the ways a ‘museum’ and digital exhibitions can function when it exists within the digital realm and is located online.
