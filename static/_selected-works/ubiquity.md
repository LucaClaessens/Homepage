# Background

In our current media landscape we consume, mainly, small bits of
information - mostly hard to place back into a bigger context. Hence, there
is an inherent value in contextually curated information, creating more
space for interpretation of the embedded content. Ubiquity offers a space
that aims to, over time, grow into a research collection on the subject
of Smart Cities implicitly following this line of thinking.


Ubiquity brings you a curated body of content, plus a set of tools -
building on technological means we have, from machine learning to content
management - to examine the topic at both large and small scale, in order
to discover relations between seemingly unconnected sectors and paradigms.
This offers a more nuanced view on the topic. This is not a luxury, but a
step towards better communication between parties involved and a better
understanding of the topic at hand.

By allowing visitors to align themselves with a background and a set level of understanding of the topic, the system could be seeded to reccomend content.

# Extensibility

Built on top of the open source [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) with a component system mounted on top of it, the technical goal of Ubiquity was to be able to be easily forked and repurposed for other topics. This would allow the creation of unique spheres curated and managed by multiple groups of interested parties.

Over time, the choice of technology proved to be suboptimal for the purpose of the concept, and the project has ground to a standstill. I'm still very interested in exploring the concept of providing tools for disseminating articles and providing a less event-based information ecosystem, and believe the idea behind Ubiquity still holds a lot of value.
