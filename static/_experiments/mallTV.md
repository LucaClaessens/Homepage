### Background

Mall TV, which originally started of as (the slightly too cryptic) `inurl:viewer_index.shtml`, was a research into the use of raw imagery.
The starting point of the research was the idea that most of the imagery we consume is in some shape or form pre-edited or enhanced.
During the discovery phase, I came across [a simple way to access](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=inurl%3Aviewer_index.shtml) what in my opinion was raw, unedited footage: unprotected security camera footage. Apparently, some low-end security systems have security measures disabled by default.
Not only is the source of the footage raw in a 'straight from the tap' type of sense, but it's also raw due to it's unpredictability. No two viewings will ever be the same.

I became somewhat fascinated with the qualities of this footage and wanted to explore ways of narrating it. Initially I landed on a camera situated in a mechanic parts shop in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, simply because I was able to fully control the camera system.

I found myself uncomfortable with the level of personal details about the location and the employees I was able to gather in a matter of days. I found 40 year employee anniversary documents, could see what people were liking on instagram on their phones and sometimes even read what they were typing, it was quite bizarre. This made me reconsider my strategy, I had to feed a bigger appetite for raw imagery by finding a larger place with access to more than one camera. This is how i came across my final subject.

### The Mall

Located in Moscow Russia lies a mall with (at the time) about 30 unprotected security cameras.
All these different views of the mall created a plethora of options to come up with interesting, funny stories. Yet, so far I only had access to video. How could I make this source a bit more captivating?

This is where the idea of computer generated storytelling started. Because the footage was somewhat random I tried segmenting camera viewports into areas and using some image analysis tools to detect movement in different segments. Did not work, analysis ruined the aspects of chance and spontaneity.
Instead, I decided to take a step back and embrace the randomness in the raw image stream and try to reconstruct the placement of the cameras in the mall. Reconstructing the space and spending time looking at all the different cameras allowed me to write stories that played with activities that happened during the day/night cycle of the building in an attempt to get people to repeatedly visit the same story to try and find different odd mashups of image and text.

To come full circle and emphasize the bizareness of the whole exploit, the page featured elevator music paired with a computer generated voice, [Milena, the russian voice the Speech Synthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis/getVoices). She was the fictional head of the cleaning crew and narrates most of the stories. 

Of course, along the way, the mall updated it's security system and MallTV had to go down.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
